# Attachment

An attachment is a part of the [Attachment Instruction](https://github.com/dlebansais/Easly-Language/blob/master/Doc/Nodes/Instruction/AttachmentInstruction.md) where a set of variables are tested to see if they conform to given types (provided in the attachment). If they do, instructions contained in the attachment are executed.

Attachments contain instruction but also have their own scope and can declare local variables.

See the Attachment instruction for details.
